# you_can_find_joy
Help us refine AI-generated code. This is a test. We asked Gemini to create the code for a basic JavaScript game with 5-levels. The objective of the game is to collect icons in order to level up.
This game came from a lighthearted conversation with a teenager about their family dog, Joy. There are so many phreases in the world that reference "joy". She and her Mom heard the phrase "you can find joy" and the teenager told her Mom, "you should make a game where people have to find Joy".

So here we are. The Mom is out Executive Director of Wengyrlz Code who loves the possibliites of AI as a tool for developers. She decided to create this as an open-source project to allow developers to learn.

Initial Repo:
The repo is made up of code generated from Gemini AI (1.5 Flash)

Here is the prompt used to generate the code:
I want to build a basic JavaScript game where icons hid in different locations as the player walks along a city road. I want the game to have 5 levels. Each level with have a different number of icons to find. Level 1 will have 10 has icons, level 2 has 15 icons, level 3 has 20 icons, level 4 has 25 icons, level 5 has 30 icons. The player can only go to te next level which is depicted as another street scene in the city after they collect all the icons.

Write the program in vanilla JavaScript. The player character is named Sky and the icons are named Joy.

**This code has not yet been tested out-of-the-box**

The repo has 2 files and an image directory:
1. A JavaScript file
2. An HTML file
